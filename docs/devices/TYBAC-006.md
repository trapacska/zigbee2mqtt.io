It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.

### Climate 
This climate device supports the following features: `local_temperature`, `current_heating_setpoint`, `system_mode`, `fan_mode`, `local_temperature_calibration`.
- `current_heating_setpoint`: Temperature setpoint. To control publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"current_heating_setpoint": VALUE}` where `VALUE` is the °C between `5` and `35`. Reading (`/get`) this attribute is not possible.
